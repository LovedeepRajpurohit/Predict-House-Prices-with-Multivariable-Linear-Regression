## Introduction
House price prediction is a critical task in real estate for buyers, sellers, and investors. This repository demonstrates how multivariable linear regression can be used to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The project is designed to be a hands-on implementation of regression concepts and techniques.

---

## Features
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on housing datasets.
- Implement multivariable linear regression using Python libraries.
- Visualize relationships between features and housing prices.
- Evaluate the regression model using metrics like RÂ², MSE, and RMSE.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LovedeepRajpurohit/Predict-House-Prices-with-Multivariable-Linear-Regression.git
   cd Predict-House-Prices-with-Multivariable-Linear-Regression
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the main notebook: `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Train the linear regression model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project should contain features like:
- `Area (sq.ft)`
- `Number of bedrooms`
- `Location`
- `Year built`
- `Price`

### Sample Dataset
If no dataset is included in this repository, you can download public datasets from sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## Model
This project implements **Multivariable Linear Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm where the target variable (house price) is predicted based on multiple independent variables (features).

### Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features.

2. Train-Test Split:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

3. Model Training:
   - Use `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn` to train the model.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like:
     - RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## Results
The results section should include:
- A summary of the model's performance metrics.
- Graphs showing predictions vs. actual prices.
- Insights gained from the data analysis and modeling.
